Progress: Brainstormed ideas for intial approaches to imagewang.

Plans: Write detailed pre-mortem. Create github repo and push current files.

Progress: Wrote plans and pre-mortem. Created github repo and pushed files. Created new Comet.ml project. Played a few games at http://www.happy-neuron.com/ to generate ideas for visual reasoning and get other ideas for learning.

Plans: Try loading a few sample images to get a feel for dir structure and get a sense of what's in our dataset, how big each split is, etc. Start following along with epoching blog (leaning towards starting with my mixup-inspired task).

Progress: Fiddled around a bit with fastai's datablocks and lower level API but concluded pytorch is more intuitive, more fun, and should work fine. As long as I make everything work with the fastai training loop I think I'll consider that requirement met. Started working on torch dataset, mostly consisting of transform that mixes 2 images (functionality isn't very generalized yet).

Plans: Fix tensor resize issue in dataset. Once I have things working in pure torch, maybe go back and take another stab at the fastai way.
