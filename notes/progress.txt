Progress: Wrote plans and pre-mortem. Created github repo and pushed files. Created new Comet.ml project. Played a few games at http://www.happy-neuron.com/ to generate ideas for visual reasoning and get other ideas for learning.

Plans: Try loading a few sample images to get a feel for dir structure and get a sense of what's in our dataset, how big each split is, etc. Start following along with epoching blog (leaning towards starting with my mixup-inspired task).
